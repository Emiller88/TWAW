# Lose Weight and Learn how to Make the Lifestyle Changes Needed to Sustain Your Results After Dieting

## Discover What Dieters are Saying about the Ideal Protein Phenomena

Most dieters know weight loss is possible given adequate motivation and
circumstances. However, most dieters gain their weight back shortly after they
complete their diet and many dieters will actually gain more weight than they
originally lost. Scientifically speaking, losing weight is easy. To lose one
pound of fat, you must burn approximately 3500 calories over and above what you
already burn doing daily activities. The real challenge, is keeping the weight
off for good.

The Ideal Protein Protocol is a short-term, 4 phase weight loss method with a
beginning, a middle, and an end. The third and fourth phases focus on educating
dieters on balanced choices in order to sustain a stable weight without
radically altering their already busy lives.

Our medically developed dieting protocol can teach you to lose weight and how to

## The Weight Loss Solution You’ve Been Looking For

There are 3 critical things to understand about weight loss that will help you maintain a balanced weight after dieting:

1. One of the greatest hazards of dieting is losing muscle mass along with fat.
2. Muscle is required to burn calories. Therefore, when you decrease your muscle mass via dieting, you will have less muscle to burn calories after you return to your regular eating patterns. In other words, you will regain your lost weight. In fact, in 1992 the National Institutes of Health reported that as much as two thirds of weight lost is regained within 1 year of completing a dieting program.
3. If you start dieting again you will lose yet more muscle, further inhibiting your ability to burn calories.

And thus the hopeless cycle of yo-yo dieting is set…unless you’ve chosen the Ideal Protein Weight Loss Method.
